## script for the training of the text tokenizer : identification of tokens (label 1) which will be used to split the text
## produces folder with models (best for each epoch) and logs


## usage : python tok_trainer.py model_name train_file.txt dev_file.txt num_train_epochs batch_size logging_steps
## where :
# model_name is the full name of the model (same name for model and tokenizer)
# train_file.txt is the file with the sentences and words of interest are identified  (words are identified with $ after the line)
# which will be used for training
## ex. : uoulentiers mais il nen est pas encor temps. Certes fait elle si$mais£Certes
# dev_file.txt is the file with the sentences and words of interest which will be used for eval
# num_train_epochs : the number of epochs we want to train (ex : 10)
# batch_size : the batch size (ex : 8)
# logging_steps : the number of logging steps (ex : 50)

# function which produces the train, which first gets texts, transforms them into tokens and labels, then trains model with the specific given arguments
